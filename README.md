# Ray_CSCI2270_FinalProject

Initial project summary:
I'm planning on simulating a deck of cards using a linked list. The initial setup will probably look much like the CommunicationNetwork assignment; there will be methods to build the deck, overhand shuffle, riffle shuffle, print the deck, find a card, and pick a random card. Beyond that, I can implement a number of different chance card games like War, as well as games like Blackjack with a simple engine.
The reason for using a linked list is that it seems to be the most easily manipulatable collection. An array would work, seeing as there's always 52 cards in the deck; however, the constant size might be an issue when making card games and removing from the middle of the deck is much easier with a linked list. A stack might work (seeing as it's a stack of cards), but that makes options very limited for getting cards from the middle of the deck.
