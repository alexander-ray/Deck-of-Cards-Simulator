# Ray_CSCI2270_FinalProject

Initial project summary:

I'm planning on simulating a deck of cards using an array. There will be methods to build the deck, shuffle the deck (possibly simulating different types of shuffling), print the deck, find a card, and pick a random card. Beyond that, I can implement a number of different chance card games like War, as well as games like Blackjack with a simple engine.

The reason for using an array is that the deck of cards itself is a static size (52 cards), so there's no need for the resizability of a linked list or vector. A more flexible data structure could be helpful for representing sets of cards with changing size (e.g. dealt cards), but an array is fine for keeping track of the entire deck.
